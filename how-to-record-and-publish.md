This is instruction to record the episode, mostly, for the host â€” Artem Zinnatullin

There're different schemes of recording podcast, I prefer next one:

1. Make a call via Skype/Hangouts/anything with all participants.
2. Connect special "bot" account to the call from another computer and record output of the call.
3. Save recording to file.
4. Process the recording via sound editor.
5. Upload the `mp3` to GitHub releases.
6. Create an issue for discussion.
7. Create show notes on GitHub in markdown.
8. Convert markdown to HTML, for example w/ [this tool](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus).
9. Escape HTML via `[[CDATA]]`.
10. Update README: add new Episode information
11. Post a PR with show notes and RSS feed update.
12. Validate resulting RSS feed, for example w/ [this tool](http://castfeedvalidator.com)
13. Add and push git tag for new episode
