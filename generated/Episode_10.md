## Notes


We know about sound volume level issue [#67](https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin/TheContext-Podcast/issues/67) and tried our best to maximize it in this episode, but Artem used his crappy headphones mic instead of professional one and we couldn't achieve what we wanted, sorry about that, we'll try our best in next episode.

We've talked to Dmitry Jemerov aka @yole from Kotlin team at JetBrains about some language design decisions made in Kotlin:

 - Package visibility in Kotlin
 - Java static equivalent in Kotlin
 - Companion objects
 - Static extension functions
 - Classes are final by default but fields are public
 - Unchecked exceptions
 - Generics
 - Base types: Any, Unit, Nothing
 - Traits
 - Delegates
 - Data classes
 - Upcoming features
