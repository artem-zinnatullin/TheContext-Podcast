# Episode 9, Part 1: Kotlin Gradle plugin, compilers and build systems with Alexey Tsvetkov

**Important note for Pocket Casts app users:**
Unfortunately Pocket Casts android app has a problem with downloading our episodes (to listen to them offline).
It seems that while downloading their android app is using a old http client which doesn't support latest TLS cipher standards we use on server side to host our episodes.  

Nevertheless, **streaming our episodes (instead of downloading) works** in Pocket Casts android app.

See this tutorial: [Pocket Casts: Streaming](http://support.pocketcasts.com/article/streaming-episodes/)
