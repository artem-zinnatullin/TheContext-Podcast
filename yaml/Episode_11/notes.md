We've talked to Artur about Juno's way to migrate their Android Riders App from RxJava 1 to RxJava 2. We have covered:

 - Migration strategy at Juno
 - What's different in RxJava 2.0?
 - Null values in RxJava 2
 - Flowable or Observable?
 - Other Rx Types: Single, Maybe and Completable
 - RxJava 2 interop library
 - RxJava 2: Default UncaughtExceptionHandler logs exceptions silently in jvm unit tests
 - RxJava 3
